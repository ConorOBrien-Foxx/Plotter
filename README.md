# Plotter

A wrapper language for J's `pd` utility.

## Installation

### Installing J and associated libraries

First, you need to grab a copy of J from [here]( http://www.jsoftware.com ). The latest version should work.

Then, download the media archive `media_platimg` from http://www.jsoftware.com/jal/j601/addons/ with the correct version, according to your OS.

Navigate to the `addons` folder of your J installation. On windows, it might look like this:

    C:\program files\j64-806\addons

Copy the `media` folder to this folder. You should now have a folder `addons\media`.

### Installing Plotter

If you have git installed, you can just type:

    git clone https://github.com/ConorOBrien-Foxx/Plotter.git

If not, you can just click on the "download" button on this repository.

### Installing the necessary libraries

Just execute:

    jconsole install.ijs
